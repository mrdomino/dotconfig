# Your garden-variety Apple Macintosh will do DHCP like a normal
# unix computer. But when it gets an IP address, it will then do
# a reverse DNS lookup on that IP, and happily take whatever the
# cafe wifi's nameserver returns _to now be the system hostname_
# so we keep a list of expected hostnames, and print an alert if
# we get a hostname that's not on that list so that we know when
# this has happened, mostly because we would like to see the fun
# new name that we have been assigned. But we don't want to just
# blanket expose our whole network topology, so these are salted.
